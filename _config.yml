user_description: I'm a Computer Science Senior at BITS-Pilani, Goa. My research interests lie broadly in Machine Learning with a focus on Natural Language Processing. My work consists of both theory and empirics in equal measure. I spent six wonderful months at Microsoft Research, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Navin Goyal. <br><br> In my spare time, I like to read books - both fiction and non-fiction. I am a big Movie and TV buff. I also love to listen to music and I have made a hobby of collecting beautiful soundtracks. I also play football, Table-Tennis and Badminton in decreasing order of pleasure and skill.
